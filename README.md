### ** Bronze Layer**

* Stores raw, unprocessed data directly from source systems.
* Data is ingested from CSV files into a SQL Server database.

### ** Silver Layer**

* Performs data cleansing, standardization, validation, and normalization.
* Prepares structured data ready for business transformation.

### ** Gold Layer**

* Contains business-ready data modeled using a **star schema**.
* Optimized for reporting, dashboards, and analytical queries.

---

## ** Project Overview**

This project includes the following components:

* **Data Architecture:** Designing a modern warehouse using Medallion layers.
* **ETL Pipelines:** Extracting, transforming, and loading data from multiple sources.
* **Data Modeling:** Developing fact and dimension tables for analytics.
* **Analytics & Reporting:** Creating SQL-based dashboards and insights.

This repository is ideal for showcasing skills in:

* SQL Development
* Data Architecture
* Data Engineering
* ETL Pipeline Development
* Data Modeling
* Data Analytics

##  Tools & Resources 

* **Datasets:** CSV files used throughout the project
* **Docker (macOS):** Runs the SQL Server container for database hosting
* **Azure Data Studio:** Cross-platform GUI for managing and querying SQL Server
* **GitHub:** Version control, documentation, and project collaboration
* **Draw.io:** Used to design architecture diagrams, data models, and ETL flows
* **Notion:** Project template, planning, and step-by-step workflow management

##  Project Requirements

### 1. Data Engineering – Build the Data Warehouse

Objective:
Create a modern SQL Server–based data warehouse that consolidates sales data into a unified analytical model.

**Specifications:**

* Import datasets from **ERP** and **CRM** CSV files
* Clean and validate data before analysis
* Integrate both sources into a unified star schema
* Only the latest dataset is required (no historization)
* Provide documentation for analytics and business teams

---

### **2. Data Analysis – BI & Analytics**

**Objective:**
Deliver data-driven insights using SQL-based analytics focusing on:

* Customer behavior
* Product performance
* Sales trends

These insights support informed, strategic decision-making.
